for RCOMP resource compiler.


1. Major but arguably cosmetic:

Redesign and rewrite command line processing to provide a more
friendly verb with meaningful qualifiers.

Call the preprocessor internally and make it possible to do away with
a batch command framework.

2. Niggling little fixes:

-v is TOO verbose.  Provide a log file capability for this and make -v
simply provide terse status and version messages.

The current verb produces useless error messages when the expected
parameters are missing.  This could be done in a much better way.

Improve the build procedures so that they work first time from the
command line.  Currently, the command line build fails because of
the way LEX/YACC source code is generated which then forms part of
the rest of the build.

3. Major but of possible strategic importance:

Generate linkable binary resources.

Generate linkable object file to satisfy external references to
resource IDs instead of generating a header file.

4. Problem fixes

The whole code is defective in that it misuses assert as a status
checking mechanism.

Lots of little defects in the code about array assumptions etc.

Make Unicode the internal character set of RCOMP, LEX and YACC.
(You know, during an idle lunchtime)

5. RCOMP language feature changes

Review the language with language design experts.

If there are unsatisfied forward references, the compiler fails to
report intervening syntax errors and instead complains about
"link name not found".  Can this be fixed?



Specifically for version 3.15:
===================================


. Implement actal mapping code for all character set types to unicode.

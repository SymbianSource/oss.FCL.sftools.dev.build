   17: *** NOTE ***
   18: 
   19: In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose
   20: sources are distributed under a license that complies with the Open
   21: Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without libcygwin.a
   22: itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.
   23: 
   24: This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
   25: and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
   26: libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the cygwin
   27: DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the DLL
   28: you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources
   29: for the cygwin DLL.
   30: 
   31: See http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html for the precise Open Source
   32: Definition referenced above.

   34: Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to
   35: provide their application in open source code form.  For more
   36: information, please see: http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/,

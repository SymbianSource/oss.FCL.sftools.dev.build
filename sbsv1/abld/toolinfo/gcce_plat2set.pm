# Description:
# This module provides a mapping from build platforms (e.g. GCCE) to the
# corresponding GCC-E environment settings.
# Currently this module only provides very simple functionality. The intention is
# that if we're going to support different GCC-E versions for different build
# platforms (as we do for RVCT) this module should be extended to provide similar
# functionality to rvct_plat2set.
# 
#

package gcce_plat2set;


# Returns the GCCE version corresponding to the given build platform. The first
# function returns the data as a string (e.g. "4.2.3"); the second function
# returns the data as a list (e.g. [4,2,3]).
sub get_version_string($);
sub get_version_list($);

# Returns true if a GCC-E version for the given platform exists.

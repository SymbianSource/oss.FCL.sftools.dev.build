# Description:
# Example build specialization file 
# 
# NB currently specialization only applies to ARMV5 build using RVCT.

# This file customizes the default ARMV5. It specifies a build that
# always uses optimization level O1 rather than the default O2.
customizes ARMV5

# The following options that can be overridden by MMP files

# Use these options when compiling user-side THUMB code
thumb_options	-thumb -O1 

# Use these options when compiling user-side ARM code
arm_options	-arm -O1 

# Use these options when compiling Kernel code
kernel_options	-arm -O1 

# This just factors out common (contingent) options from the above.
# These options can also be overridden by MMP files.
common_options	--diag_suppress 1,161,654,1135,1152,1300 --diag_error 1267

# Fixed options for this build. These options should only be changed with great care since
# they have the potential to introduce incompatible ABI (or machine) level effects.
# -cpu 5T - this build just targets a generic 5T
# -Ono_known_library - we use our own library so tell the compiler not to make assumptions about its implementation
# -fpu softvfp - some system code explicitly assumes this variant of the EABI (softvfp+vfp could be used on say XScale)
# --dll_vtbl - this switches on class exporting and is needed to support Symbian OS DLL model
# -apcs /inter - redundant on 5T, but worth saying anyway
invariant_options	-cpu 5T -fy -Ono_known_library -fpu softvfp --dll_vtbl -apcs /inter

	Because Raptor is not part of the OS it needs to know some properties of
	the OS that it is building. If you are building an older OS than the one
	configured by default then you need to put a file like this one into the
	folder EPOCROOT/epoc32/sbs_config
	
	The file can have any name as long as it ends with ".xml"

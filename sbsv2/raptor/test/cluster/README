Testing a Cluster to See if it is Correctly Configured
--------------------------------------------------------

The tests in this directory can be seen only as examples of how to test a cluster.  They would have to be customised before use on any particular cluster.

The tests here are aimed at:

1) Testing that the configuration of each nodes and that services such as NIS,DNS and NTP are configured.
  This requires that logins for the current user work on all nodes.
2) Checking that raptor-relevant software is installed and that the compiler can obtain licenses.
3) Testing that PVM is installed and will run without crashing (solves a problem that has occurred in the past).
4) Tests that PVM can run commands on all nodes.


Typically one would run headtest.sh which performs the tests relating to items 1-3. It causes "nodetest.sh" to be run on all nodes.

e.g.
	./headtest.sh node1 node2 node3

pvmtest.sh can be used to check that pvm is working by running the compiler on each node via pvm.
	./pvmtest node1 node2 node3

None of these tests is automatic - one must simply observe the output.

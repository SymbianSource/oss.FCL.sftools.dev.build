A very simple TEM test

This is more aimed at the TEM mechanism rather than TEMs themselves.

There are several bld infs:
bld.inf      - is expected to build without errors
bad_bld.inf  - is expected to generate duplicate TEM calls
bad2_bld.inf - is expected to ensure that options are passing through to TEM unchanged

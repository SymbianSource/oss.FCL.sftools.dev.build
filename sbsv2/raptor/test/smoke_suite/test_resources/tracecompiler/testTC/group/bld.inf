/*
*  You need tracecompiler to run this test.
*
*  If you run this test from Raptor test frame you need to zip your tracecompiler
*  and put it under "$(SBS_HOME)/test/manual_tests/test_resources/" first, then Raptor will unzip it later. 
*  This is because Raptor test frame removes tracecompiler from epoc32/tools/ at the very beginning, 
*  so you have to export to put it "back there" again.
*
*  If you run this test NOT from Raptor test frame you do not need to do the above.
*  Please just remove PRJ_EXPORTS and its contents below.

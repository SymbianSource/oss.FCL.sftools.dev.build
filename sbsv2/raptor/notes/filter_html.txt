There is a new log filter to generate HTML output. For example,

sbs --filters=html -f logdir

will produce an output file "logdir/index.html" and other supporting files
in the directory "logdir". This can be used alongside the Bz2 filter to
generate both a human readable summary and a compressed log for further
detailed machine analysis if required: for example,

sbs --filters=html,bz2log -f name

will produce a folder "name" and a file "name.bz2".


If a build is done in several parts, for example,

sbs -s sys1.xml --filters=html,bz2log -f build/part1
sbs -s sys2.xml --filters=html,bz2log -f build/part2
sbs -s sys3.xml --filters=html,bz2log -f build/part3

Then there is a new script "SBS_HOME/bin/sbs_index.py" which can produce a
single index linking to all the individual parts: for example,

sbs_index.py build/part1 build/part2 build/part3 build/index.html

the first parameters are the directories to search for summaries and the
last parameter is the name of the overall index file. Directories are
searched recursively, so the above example is the same as,

sbs_index.py build build/index.html


Text in the Raptor logs is classified as Error, Warning or Remark using the
list of regular expressions in the file SBS_HOME/lib/config/logfile_regex.csv
but this can be overriden by placing a file of the same name in the kit in
its EPOCROOT/epoc32/sbs_config folder.


The filter also checks that all the files which were listed in "what" output
actually exist at the end of the build. Any files which don't exist are
recorded as "Missing files".

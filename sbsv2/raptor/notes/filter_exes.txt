Use the filter_exes filter to generate a set of files listing the executables
created in a build.  A separate file will be created for each layer name and
each configuration containing executable files.  The filter can be run on an
existing log file as follows:

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes < logfile
where 'logfile' is the name of the logfile you want to analyse.

By default it will create the files in the current directory, named
'<layer>_<config>.txt' e.g. 'layerone_armv5_urel.txt'.  If layers are not in
use (e.g. the build was not based on a system definition) the layer name used
will be 'nolayer' - e.g. 'nolayer_armv5_udeb.txt'.

The location for output files can be overridden using the 'output' argument.
To limit its operation to specified layers or configs, the 'layer' and 'config'
arguments can be supplied, multiple times if necessary:

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes[output=mydir,layer=layerone,layer=layertwo,config=armv5_urel] < logfile

This will search for executables generated from either 'layerone' or 'layertwo'
components which were also build for armv5_urel.  The filter will record an
executable if it matches any of the layers specified and also was built for any
of the configs specified.

The files contain a list of filenames with no paths and no other information, 
for example:

HelloWorld.exe
Dummy.exe
epoc.exe
[...]

A file will only be produced if there are any filenames to go into it.  The
filter will report on any files that have been created e.g:

Wrote 242 file(s) into layerone_armv5_urel.txt
Write 45 file(s) into layertwo_armv5_urel.txt

Note that argument names may be abbreviated e.g.

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes[o=mydir,l=layerone,c=armv5_urel] < logfile

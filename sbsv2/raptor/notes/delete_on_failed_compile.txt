In certain circumstances, such as failure to obtain licenses, RVCT 2.2's armcc 
program still produces object files whose contents is junk. This causes build 
problems later as from Make's point of view those object files are "up to 
date" so the build tries to link them. Of course, these attempts at linking 
fail and the build is broken.

This is a work around for that RVCT 2.2 problem.

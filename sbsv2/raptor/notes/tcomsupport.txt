New Trace Compiler
-------------------

Raptor supports an updated version of the Trace Compiler which has
an improved command-line interface that allows Raptor to specify the
directory in which trace data should be written.  This allows MMPs to
implement a new convention for where trace files are stored.

The new convention prevents clashes where building the same
source file for different MMPs would previously have resulted in two
build tasks trying to create the same trace file (header/dictionary).
This caused build slowdowns and also made the trace data inaccurate.

The standard for this directory is that the last two elements of the
path should be

   traces/traces_<targetname>_<ext>

e.g.

   traces/traces_euser_dll

The new trace compiler also creates "autogen" headers in a new location
under epoc32/include/platform rather than epoc32/include/internal.

Trace Headers Directory can now also be in SYSTEMINCLUDEs
----------------------------------------------------------

Some teams were having trouble getting qmake to generate MMPs with
USERINCLUDEs set.  So they were specifying the trace header directory in
their SYTEMINCLUDEs.  This change causes Raptor to look for the traces
directory in bot SYSTEMINCLUDES and USERINCLUDES.


Create Trace Directories During Makefile Parse
-----------------------------------------------

Some build engines consider it a "clash" when two jobs attempt to make the
same directory.  This change causes some important trace output directories
to be created during makefile parsing which removes the (small) possibility
that they would clash during the build part.

Raptor supports a new interface to the trace compiler that allows
Raptor to specify the direcotry in which trace data should be written.
This allows components to support a new convention for where trace files
are stored.

The new convention that prevents the clashes where building the same
source file for different MMPs would previously have resulted in two
build tasks trying to create the same trace file (header/dictionary).
This caused build slowdowns and also made the trace data inaccurate.

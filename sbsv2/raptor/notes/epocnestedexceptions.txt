Qt needs to be able to have more than one active exception object, even when
OOM (out-of-memory).

A detailed overview of the solution can be found at 
http://wikis.in.nokia.com/Toolchain/QtExceptionHandling

In short, we add a new MMP flag keyword - EPOCNESTEDEXCEPTIONS. When this
keyword is specified, a different static run-time library is used.

The "nodebug" variant causes executables to be built without debug
information.  It does not affect the macros that are passed to debug
executables or the optimisation flags.

The use case for nodebug is for a situation where some executables are
so large that they trigger a problem in RVCT2.2's linker for the "udeb"
version of the executable but not for the "urel" version.  There is no
known solution for this problem without using a new compiler and since
it isn't currently possible to use different compilers in the same build
this is not an option.

This variant makes the udeb build of the executable much less useful for
debugging purposes so it is an undesirable workaround for a build problem but
there is no alternative.   Newer versions of Symbian support newer compilers
and will not need this feature.  It is also not needed when building with GCCE.
We strongly recommend against using this feature.

For exectuables with this problem one must use the APPLY keyword in the mmp
like so:

apply nodebug

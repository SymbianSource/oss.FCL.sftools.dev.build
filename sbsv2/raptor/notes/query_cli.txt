A new --query command-line option allows other tools to easily read raptor's
configuration data without having to understand exactly how raptor config
files work.

For example, all the valid build aliases which can be used to build with
the -c option can be obtained using:

sbs --query=aliases

All the known product variants can be obtained using:

sbs --query=products

And the details of a particular configuration can be found using:

sbs --query=config[armv5_urel.n8]

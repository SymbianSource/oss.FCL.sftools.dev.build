A requirement on Raptor is to allow all the tools to be configurable via 
environment variables. To this end, updates have been made to extend the list 
of tools that can be configured using environment variables.

The list of new SBS_*** environment variables and their purpose is given below:

SBS_EPOCTOOLS       Directory for epoc32 tools; defaults to $EPOCROOT/epoc32/tools
                    Changes the default locations for all of the following tools.
SBS_CHECKLIB        Full path to checklib program
SBS_DEF2DLL         perl, followed by full path to def2dll.pl
SBS_EFREEZE         perl, followed by full path to efreeze.pl
SBS_ELF2E32         Full path to elf2e32 program
SBS_GENDEF          perl, followed by full path to gendef.pl
SBS_MAKEDEF         perl, followed by full path to makedef.pl
SBS_PETRAN          perl, followed by full path to petran.pl
SBS_PREPDEF         perl, followed by full path to prepdef.pl
SBS_RCOMP           Full path to rcomp program
SBS_SYMLOOKUPUTIL   perl, followed by full path to sym_lkup_util.pl
SBS_TRANASM         perl, followed by full path to tranasm.pl

SBS_GCC_BIN         Linux only: full path to GCC and associated tools 
SBS_MINGW_LINUX_BIN Linux only: location of MINGW tools for Linux-hosted 
	            cross-compilation of Win32 tools2 targets
SBS_SLASHBIN        Linux only: location of /bin, i.e. an alternative location for
                    GCC and associated tools
SBS_USRBIN          Linux only: location of /usr/bin, i.e. an alternative location 
                    for Gnu tools such as the Core Utils

SBS_STLPORTINCDIR         Location of STLport headers files (tools2 builds only)
SBS_STLPORTBINDIR         Location of STLport library (tools2 builds only). 
                          Assumes that there is a "rel" and "deb" directory
                          immediately under this directory containing the
                          STLport library (release and debug version 
                          respectively).
SBS_STLPORTINCDIR_WIN32   Location of STLport headers files for Linux-hosted 
                          cross-compilation of Win32 tools2 targets. Only 
                          applicable when using the "win32" variant, 
                          i.e. "tools2.win32"
SBS_STLPORTBINDIR_WIN32   Location of STLport library for Linux-hosted 
                          cross-compilation of Win32 tools2 targets. Only 
                          applicable when using the "win32" variant, 
                          i.e. "tools2.win32". 
                          Assumes that there is a "rel" and "deb" directory
                          immediately under this directory containing the
                          STLport library (release and debug version 
                          respectively).

In the case Perl scripts (.pl files), "perl" can be replaced with the full path to 
the perl program.

The above variables supercede the following environment variables:

CHECKLIB
EFREEZE
ELF2E32
GENDEF
MAKEDEF
PETRAN
PREPDEF
RCOMP
TRANASM

which are no longer in use.

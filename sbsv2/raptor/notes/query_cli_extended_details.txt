The --query command-line option has been extended to print more detailed
information about a given configuration.

Querying aliases now prints the list in sorted order, by name attribute.
Ditto for products.

Querying a configuration now prints the following additional information:

1. include paths used for preprocessing bld.infs and MMPs
2. pre-include header file for preprocessing bld.infs and MMPs
3. pre-include header file passed to the compiler in a build (if used)
4. macros used to preprocess bld.infs and MMPs (with values, if explicitly set)
5. core macros used in compilation preprocessing (with values, if explicitly set)
6. available values to use as the targettype in MMPs

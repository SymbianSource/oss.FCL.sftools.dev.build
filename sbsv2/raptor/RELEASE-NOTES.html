<pre>
version 2.12.5

Defect Fixes:
- Fix: Workaround for emake engine log corruption when clockskew errors occur (annofile2log).
  Allow Raptor to obtain log from emake annotation file where it is uncorrupted.  A new 
  Make engine option "copylogfromannofile" enables/disables this mode for emake. If this option is disabled
  or if no annotation file is specified for the build then Raptor reads logs directly as normal.
- SF Bug 2125 - [Raptor] - tracecompiler what output incorrect if mmp basename contains '.' e.g. fred.prd.mmp 
- SF Bug 2191 - [Raptor] - When forcesuccess is enabled, exit status for a failed recipe is "retry" but should be "failed"
- Fix: extend tracecompiler tests to Linux
- Fix: Amendment to SF Bug 1511 fix - removal of blanked DEFFILE keyword from e32abiv2ani.flm
- Fix: improve robustness to bad -c options


version 2.12.4

Defect Fixes:
- SF Bug 2113 - [Raptor] what/check filters can assign files to the wrong components
- SF Bug 2081 - [Raptor] - Exported file executable permissions not maintained (linux)
- Fix: host attribute in recipes was blank in windows, windows cluster builds.
- SF Bug 1912 - Raptor should take python from the path [if not set with SBS_PYTHON or bundled with Raptor]
- SF Bug 2042 - [Raptor] component field empty in recipe
- SF Bug 2007 - [Raptor] GCCE 4.4.1 builds require 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 SBS_GCCE???BIN env vars etc.
- SF Bug 2000 - [Raptor] Talon fails when installed in a path containing the string '-c' (windows only)
- SF Bug 1861 - [Raptor] More helpful console message in case of timeouts
- SF Bug 1571 - Raptor cannot report error or warning message in wrong implib project
- DPDEF142718 Incremental rebuild fails if dependent files deleted
  --no-depend-generate added to suppress the generation and processing of dependency files
  .DEFAULT target introduced for all non --no-depend-generate and/or --no-depend-include builds
- Add support for PLUGIN3 TARGETTYPEs
- Fixing logfile corruption for large GCCXML builds by suppressing zip output
- Stop copying .bmp files to epoc32/localisation and fix the "what" reporting


version 2.12.3

Defect Fixes:
- Don't print trace "what" information if we do not run the trace compiler.


version 2.12.2

Defect Fixes:
- SF Bug 1569 - excessive recompilation in incremental tracecompiler builds
- Better error messages for make-engine selection.
  e.g. "sbs -e arm" will now produce a useful error message rather than 
  a traceback. "arm" is a real variant but it's not a make engine.  In
  the past sbs would have tried to use it and would have failed with a
  complicated traceback. Also doesn't traceback for non-existent make engines.
- sbs_filter chose wrong embedded default python version. Set to 2.6.4 now.
- FilterCheck did not check files when run from sbs_filter
- Remove old references to python 2.5.2
- Escape filenames with special XML characters inside &lt;member&gt; tags


version 2.12.1

Defect Fixes:
- SF Bug 1494 - sbs --what does not report Trace Compiler output
- sbs -c winscw.tracecompiler uses wrong UID and doesn't generate traces
- SF Bug 1519 - Raptor output files may contain unescaped left angle brackets as XML character data


version 2.12.0

New Features:
- New 'Patchable Constants' target type: TARGETTYPE pdll
- Combine Linking and Postlinking into a single step - performance improvement.
- Support exit codes from next version of the trace compiler which will issue them
- New sbs_filter script and batchfile to ease the use of sbs_filter.py.  
  Allows filters to be executed over a log after a build has been done.
    e.g.

  	sbs_filter --filters=FilterWhat < logfile.log 

    (This runs a "--what" without regenerating any makefiles or reparsing
    the matadata.)
- New (beta) FilterWhatComp filter.  Simulates abld log output for
  use with parse_what.pl for packing up zips by component.  Whatcomp output
  uses the incoming epocroot value.  i.e. if epocroot is relative then so is
  the what output.  e.g. if EPOCROOT=\ then the output will be of the form:

	"\epoc32\release\armv5\...."  

  If it's "..\myepocroot" then the output will be:

	"..\myepocroot\epoc32\release\armv5".  

  If it's absolute then the what output will also be absolute.
- New FilterCheck filter.  This can be used with sbs_filter to perform the 
  equivalent of --check using the log output from a build.  It is more
  efficient than --check because the metadata is not parsed and no makefiles
  are generated. e.g.

	sbs_filter --filters=FilterCheck < logfile.log 

- New (beta) graphical build visualisation tool (bin/timelines.py). 
  Requires pygame and PyOpenGL. e.g.

	python timelines.py < filename.log

- New (beta) log analyser (recipestats.py) for recording the total time spent 
  in each type of recipe in the build. e.g.

	python recipestats.py < filename.log > stats.csv

  The output is in CSV format.  

Defect Fixes:
- fix for ARM9E + ARMV5 pre-processing confusion
- SF bug 1606: template_ext.flm wrongly creates dependencies to OTHER_CFG targets
- SF bug 1570: Adding then removing a capability can produce incorrect 
  result: e.g. ALL TCB -TCB becomes ALL -TCB but it should be just ALL

Other Changes:
- Default to using Python 2.6.4 on windows (no change in compatibility with 
  older versions of Python).

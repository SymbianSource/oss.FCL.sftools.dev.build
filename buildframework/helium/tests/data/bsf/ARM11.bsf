# Fixed options for this build. These options should only be changed with great care since
# they have the potential to introduce incompatible ABI (or machine) level effects.
# -cpu 5T - this build just targets a generic 5T
# -Ono_known_library - we use our own library so tell the compiler not to make assumptions about its implementation
# -fpu softvfp - some system code explicitly assumes this variant of the EABI (softvfp+vfp could be used on say XScale)
# --dll_vtbl - this switches on class exporting and is needed to support Symbian OS DLL model
# -apcs /inter - redundant on 5T, but worth saying anyway
# --enum_is_int - force all enum entries to be sizeof(int) which avoids problems when passing enums between 5T and 9E libs

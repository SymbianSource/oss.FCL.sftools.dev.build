Cleaning the build machines
---------------------------

After several builds have been run it is necessary to clean the build machine of old work areas. Deleting several work areas run under the same username can be done using the ``clean-pc`` command, which displays a dialog showing the build area directories. Select the checkboxes of those to be deleted.

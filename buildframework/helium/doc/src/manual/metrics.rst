Introduction
============

This describes the types of build and release metrics that can be collected using Helium and a Diamonds installation and how they can be collected.

Diamonds Link for builds:
=========================
    Diamonds homepage: <http://diamonds.nmp.nokia.com/diamonds>


Helium configuration
====================
To enable logging to diamonds from Helium one needs to ensure that:

* The properties ``diamonds.host`` and ``diamonds.port`` are set correctly.
* By default they are taken from ``helium/tools/common/companyproperties.ant.xml``, but can be overridden by using:

  * **Command line**    
  
    For example, if the Diamonds server IP address changed to ``new.diamonds.server:newport`` then you would use:
    
    * *hlm.bat -Ddiamonds.host=new.diamonds.server -Ddiamonds.port=newport*

  * **ANT team file** 
   
    For example, if the Diamonds server IP address changed to ``new.diamonds.server:newport`` then you would put the following lines in your ``<team>.ant.xml``::

    <property name="diamonds.host" value="new.diamonds.server"/>*  
    <property name="diamonds.port" value="newport"/>*

* If you define the property :hlm-p:`diamonds.enabled` to ``false`` Diamonds is disabled.

Diamonds server configuration
=============================

Config file: ``helium/config/diamonds_config.xml.ftl``.


Properties need to be defined for successful logging:

   :header: "Property name", "Description"
   
   "``diamonds.host``", "Diamonds server address"

Metrics
=======

    
Metrics name: Build duration
----------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Build duration in hours as a function of time.

Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The started time and finished time are uploaded to diamonds automatically from Helium. 
    
Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Summary.  
    
    For categorization by product programs, Build->Click "category" hyperlink. For 
    categorization by build accelerators, Build->Other->Click "Build system" hyperlink.
    
    
RVCT compiler warnings 
----------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
    Number of build warnings in SW build - RVCT compiler warnings to tell about the quality of the software.
    
Collection Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Number of RVCT bad warnings, warnings and errors are send to diamond aumatically from Helium after each build.

Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Summary->Compilation error summary.
    

Metrics name: "number of object files" and "number of generated files"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Number of object files and generated files for a build    

Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Necessary data are collected from build information automatically    

    Based on helium/config/diamonds_config.xml.ftl cofiguration, Helium automatically sends the start and end time of a stage to diamonds.

        
Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Others->Object files & Generated files.  
   
   
Metrics name: Build stage duration
----------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Date and time of start and finish. A=Date and time of start B= Date and time of finish.
    Metric = B-A calculated for each build stages. In the graph only the 4 main stages are shown.\

        * *1. pre-build (Synergy check outs and snapshots, build area preparation)*
        * *2. build (main build)*
        * *3. post build (Post build, China, Japan, EE images, EE zip,  Localization, Localized roms)*
        * *4. release to channels (db, ftp, network disk)*

Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The started time and finished time are uploaded to diamonds automatically from Helium. 
    
Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Summary. Click "Stages>>"
    
    
Metrics name: API Usage
----------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Types of api are private, internal, domain and sdk. Illegal API is (internal+private), if  any illegal api exists it will show the Illegal API's name with path.

Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If disable.analysis.tool is not set, data will be uploaded to diamonds automatically from Helium. 
    
Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Other->API usage  


Metrics name: Build tags
------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Build tags are used to group builds for metric collection purposes.

Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    To send custom build tags to Diamonds the property diamonds.build.tags should be set as follows:
     * For a single build tag (e.g. "build_tag1") -> hlm -Ddiamonds.build.tags="build_tag1" 
     * For multiple build tags (e.g. "build_tag1" and "build_tagN") -> hlm -Ddiamonds.build.tags="build_tag1,build_tagN" 
    
    Note:
    * Build tags should not exceed 50 characters.
    * Duplicate build tags will be ignored. 
    * If an "Available Tag" is set, then in Diamonds it gets removed from that list and transferred to "Build's Tags" list.

Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Tags->Build's Tags.  
    
    For categorization by tags, Click Builds->"Navigation" pane->"Build Archives"->by tags 


Metrics name: Information about "base environment" 
--------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Information about what "base environment" is unzipped.
    
Collection method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Necessary data are collected from build information automatically if currentRelease.xml exists in the environment. 
    
Location in Diamonds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In Diamonds, Builds->Content. See "Input" for s60.

########## GUIDELINES 
# 
# - If any paths contain spaces, place them in "Quotes"
# - If some parameter is not to be used, it can be empty or completely removed
#   from the config file


########## MANDATORY COMMON PARAMETERS 
#
# Name for baseline file set
BASELINE_NAME='SDK 3rd Edition'

# Root directory for files in baseline directory. It's a mandatory parameter.
BASELINE_SDK_DIR=C:\Symbian\9.2\S60_3rd_FP1_2

# S60 version of baseline set.It can be any of the following
# 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 5.0, 9.1, 9.2,,10.1, S^1, S^2,S^3,S^4 (S^1, S^2,S^3,S^4 are for symbian 1,2,3,4 SDk versions respectively).
BASELINE_SDK_S60_VERSION=3.0

# Name for current file set
CURRENT_NAME=RnD SDK wk26

# Root directory for files in current directory. It's a mandatory parameter.
CURRENT_SDK_DIR=Y:\

# S60 version of current set.It can be any of the following
# 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 5.0, 9.1, 9.2,,10.1, S^1, S^2,S^3,S^4 (S^1, S^2,S^3,S^4 are for symbian 1,2,3,4 SDk versions respectively).
CURRENT_SDK_S60_VERSION=3.1


########## OPTIONAL COMMON PARAMETERS 
#
# Defines the path for intermediate temporary files
# Uses system defined paths if empty
TEMP=


########## OPTIONAL HEADER ANALYSIS SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 

# Mark as 'true', if Public vs Rnd sdk or small no of headers ( count < 3000) analysis will be done.
# defaults to 'false' if not defined. Analysis time will be increased.
# When analysing large no of headers, multiple Thread logic needs to be disabled to avoid issues due to high memory consumption .
USE_THREAD=

# Analyse any header directory, other than \epoc32\include. This will override
# the default SDK paths. Multiple names separated by ‘;’ can be input. If they 
# are relative paths, BASELINE_SDK_DIR\epoc32\include and 
# CURRENT_SDK_DIR\epoc32\include will be inserted at the begining.
BASELINE_HEADERS=
CURRENT_HEADERS=

# Specifies the dependant header directories. Multiple names separated by ‘;’
# can be input. If defined or not, default system defined inputs will be taken
# along with these always. If they are relative paths, 
# BASELINE_SDK_DIR\epoc32\include and CURRENT_SDK_DIR\epoc32\include will be 
# inserted at the begining.
BASELINE_SYSTEMINCLUDEDIR=
CURRENT_SYSTEMINCLUDEDIR=

# Additional headers that have to be included for successful compilation of the
# header files. Multiple names separated by ‘;’ can be input.
BASELINE_FORCED_HEADERS=
CURRENT_FORCED_HEADERS=

# Usage of platform data to resolve compile time dependency information,
# defaults to 'true' if not defined
USE_PLATFORM_DATA=

# Recurse the directory hierarchy while scanning for files under verification,
# defaults to 'true' if not defined
RECURSIVE_HEADERS=

# If the recursive scan is enabled, optionally exclude some subdirectories,
# defaults to be none if not defined. Multiple names separated by ‘;’ can 
# be input.
EXCLUDE_DIR_HEADERS=

# File pairs to be compared, if names change between base & current releases,
# Format, OLD:NEW, each such set is separated by ‘;’, defaults to none
REPLACE_HEADERS=

# Report file for header analysis, report file created under reports directory
# with a default file name if not specified
REPORT_FILE_HEADERS=Y:/output/logs/BC/headers_report.xml

# Similar as above, but this is the path of the filtered report file, otherwise
# the same file name is used
FILTER_FILE_HEADERS=


########## OPTIONAL LIBRARY ANALYSIS SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
#
# Type of the tool chain (GCC/GGCE/RVCT) which is used fetch information from the
# import libraries under analysis, defaults to GCCE if not specified
TOOLCHAIN=

# Path to the tool chain mentioned above, path found automatically if not specified
TOOLCHAIN_PATH=

# Target build directories of the import libraries (eg ARMV5/ARMV6). Defaults to
# ARMV5. Please note that WINSCW is not supported. Multiple names separated by 
# ‘;’ can be input.
BASELINE_BUILDTARGET=
CURRENT_BUILDTARGET=

# Analyse any other import library directory than from under \epoc32\release.
# This will override target builds mentioned above. Multiple names separated 
# by ‘;’ can be input. If they are relative paths, 
# BASELINE_SDK_DIR\epoc32\release and CURRENT_SDK_DIR\epoc32\release will be 
# inserted at the begining. If any of these param is mentioned, corresponding 
# dll path also needs to be mentioned.
BASELINE_IMPORTLIBRARIES=
CURRENT_IMPORTLIBRARIES=

# Analyse any other dll directory than from under \epoc32\release. This will 
# override target builds mentioned above. Multiple names separated by ‘;’ can
# be input. If they are relative paths, BASELINE_SDK_DIR\epoc32\release and 
# CURRENT_SDK_DIR\epoc32\release will be inserted at the begining. If any of 
# these param is mentioned,corresponding lib path is also needs to be mentioned.
BASELINE_IMPORTDLLS=
CURRENT_IMPORTDLLS=

# Report file for library analysis, report file created under reports directory
# with a default file name if not specified
REPORT_FILE_LIBRARIES=Y:/output/logs/BC/libraries_report.xml

# Similar as above, but this is the path of the filtered report file, otherwise
# the same file name is used
FILTER_FILE_LIBRARIES=


########## OPTIONAL REPORT FILTERING SPECIFIC PARAMETERS
#
# Report files to be filtered, multiple reports can be mentioned here separated
# by ';'. In addition, peport paths mentioned in headers, libraries section are
# also filtered
REPORT_FILE_FILTER=

# Same as above, but specifies paths for filtered report files. There is a
# correspondance between report file above and the output file. If a report
# file does not have a corresponding Output file mentioned then it is filtered
# in-place.
OUTPUT_FILE_FILTER=

# Defines paths for knownissues files separated by ';' which can be either local
# directory or a server path. Defaults to the default knownissues file
# delivered by the tool
ISSUES_FILE=

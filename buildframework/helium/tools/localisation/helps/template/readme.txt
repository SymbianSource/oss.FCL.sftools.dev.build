---------------------------

This template is an example of how to integrate that helper into a product help delivery for 3.2 products.
It relies on the following
 * PRODUCT_VARIANTS variable defined as a list product variant for the help delivery. (e.g. PRODUCT and PRODUCT_edge)
 * productname_IBYFILE defines where to generate the iby file for productname
 * productname_TAG defines what type to use for this product variant type.
 * HELIUM_HOME to be defined

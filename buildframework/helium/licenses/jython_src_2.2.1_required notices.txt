   78:       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   79:       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   80:       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   81:       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   82:       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   83:       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   84:       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   85:       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   86:       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   87:       as of the date such litigation is filed.
   88: 
   89:    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

   95:           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   96:

   98:           stating that You changed the files; and
   99: 
  100:       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  101:           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  102:           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  103:           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  104:           the Derivative Works; and
  105: 
  106:       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  107:           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  108:           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  109:           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  110:           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  111:           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  112:           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  113:           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  114:           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  115:           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  116:           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  117:           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  118:           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  119:           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  120:           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  121:           as modifying the License.
  122: 
  123:       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  124:       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  125:       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  126:       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  127:       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  128:       the conditions stated in this License.
  129: 
  130:    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  131:       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

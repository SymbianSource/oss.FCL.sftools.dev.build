  176: B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  177: =======================================================
  178: 
  179: JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the

  181: took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.
  182: 
  183: In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
  184: where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
  185: under the Jython specific license below.
  186: 
  187: From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
  188: Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
  189: covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.
  190: 
  191: The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
  192: license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.
  193: 
  194: The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
  195: under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
  196: Software License.
  197: 
  198: The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
  199: License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.
